When you'll run the JAR file two windows should appear:
- One at the left is the window which represents the map and on which all the action is going to happen
- One at the right is the window which represents the control panel to create the Prey and Predators and start the map itself

You can start the map after at least one instance of the Prey is created. As you start the map you can click on the source, hideout or the animal to see information about them and perform some actions on them.
